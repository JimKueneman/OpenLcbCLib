OpenLcbCLib is a project to create a cross platform C based library for developing OpenLcb/Lcc nodes specifically for micro controllers but the goal it that it will be cross platform and can be compiled for many microcontroller and PC platforms.

Currently the library has demos running on dsPICs, MSPM0, STM32, MacOS and ESP32 demos using Code Composer Thiea, STM Cube IDE, MPLAB X, Arduino IDE, VSCode with PlatformIO and XCode.

The help file for the OpenLcbCLib can be found here: [Help File](https://jimkueneman.github.io/OpenLcbCLib/documentation/help/html/)
