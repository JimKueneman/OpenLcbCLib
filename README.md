OpenLcbCLib is a project to create a cross platform C based library for developing OpenLcb/Lcc nodes specifically for micro controllers but the goal it that it will be cross platform and can be compiled for many microcontroller and PC platforms.

This is not the code that I had working on the dsPIC.  Stuart recommended a few things so there is a lot of work going on to rename/refactor/reorganize things that have made me go backwards for a bit I as work through the mess.
