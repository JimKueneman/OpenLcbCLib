Copies the latest version of the library to the sub folders in the Demo Applications.  The rules for how a library structure should be setup is different between IDEs (Arduino is the most restrictive in including/excluding files and file types).  

Instead of trying to teach how to set up any IDE the demos simply copy the *.h and *.c files under the /src folder into a sub folder named /src in each demo.

This automates that copy task for each demo.
