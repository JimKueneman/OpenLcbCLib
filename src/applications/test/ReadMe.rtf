\f0\fs24 \cf0 This folder contain isolated tests on various parts of the code.  It is mostly aimed at the core functionality and not the transport hardware drivers so you can test logic and functionality in the simulator or other ways.\
\
The main test environment for the main developer is Microchip MPLab X so within each individual test folder is a sub folder with the *.X extension where the MPLab project folder lives for the test.\
\
Any more general test code (google test maybe) can be placed in the first level above the MPLab folders.}
