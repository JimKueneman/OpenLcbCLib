A simple example of compiling in an Arduino IDE environment

Prerequisites for compiling.  This uses the MCP2517/18 CAN to SPI chip and the ACAN2517 library by Pierre Molinaro (is in the available libraries to install from the IDE search on ACAN2517)

Next is the correct Pico Board you must use this board library by Philhower not Mbed.  The directions to add the link in the Arduino IDE settings dialog are on the main page

Then look for "Raspberry Pi Pico/RP2040/RP2350" by Earl F Philhower.
